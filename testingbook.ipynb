Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a\"creative\" mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love.\""

I like the relatively fast paced gameplay, less down time, more engagements, smaller maps and leathal weapons make for epic flanks, as a result i feel like as a single player i can have a decent impact on a game - i just enjoy the pacing and the way combat plays out (im nervous that the infantry vehicles will fuck this up). I'll admit that PS's wider range of factions does look very attractive but at the end of the day whats the point in having all these unique and interesting guns and what not when for most of the game you arent going to be using them because your going to be on the move and then when you do its spamming suppressing fire at a hedge. Edit: to be clear i might be 100% wrong about PS i havent played it but thats just the vibe i got from the gameplay ive seen.\n",

What if a tiny percent of the playerbase actually played solo when it was available. What if those who are most vocal are just a very small minorty of players.  More than likely they have so much information from every one of us playing the game that they probably have a good idea about what they are doing.

(2 billion Christians and 1.8 billion Muslims).   If that's not a sign that he's the messiah then I don't think anything will convince the Jews.\"\n",

Therefore it's already the established theory that the Earth is globular and not flat, and the burden of proof falls on whoever wishes to prove it is flat.  Similarly, theists claim there is a god or gods. There has been no evidence proving such a entity or entitys exist by any evidence based theory.

Some men were only attracted to certain women and vice versa. That was just attraction! Christians surely would never open up about sex, but would on their anoymous blogs. That's where I read the account of a lady and her husband who wrote down what they liked about sex and swapped lists - they were complete opposites! No wonder neither of them were satisfied with their sex lives! So Christians make sexually incompatible marriages work because many don't believe in divorce, but it isn't exactly a walk in the park. Since premarital sex is viewed as sin and everyone knows it, you have to decide which guns you'll stick to.

Do you know how upset people would be if every season less and less gay men drag queens got on the show because real women got on in their stead if they started letting women on?\"\n",

The idea is that you can wait to actually go on HRT until youre an adult and can be sure youre trans. If youre not, you just stop taking the blockers and go through puberty. If you are, it makes HRT a lot more effective.  Obviously this isnt allowed in all cases, and psychiatric approval is required, but having transphobic parents that dont allow you to start taking puberty blockers can be really damaging. I know the whole making me go through puberty without my consent thing sounds ridiculous, but its actually a real issue.\"\n",

I think an underlying mechanism of \"falling away\" from the church is that our own assumptions collapse. We no longer, well, *assume* them.  The fault in Pascal's wager is that it's a false dichotomy. It's between just two assumptions; the specific sect in question...or not.  But when your assumption that one sect stands out collapses, you have to consider *any* sect. When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect. Most Mormons have never seriously considered another religion being true, and they hold specific prejudices about why some aren't true (Catholics, Protestants).

Anyway...  If you can ignore the fringe vegans who literally think humans are herbivores (I mean honestly... believing humans never did, physically can't/shouldn't eat meat is not a requirement for being vegan and most of us do know that we are omnivores) and really evaluate the technology and resources we now have access to as modern humans, then the discussion about whether humans should be eating meat and animal products can be more productive and realistic given the context within which we now make our dietary choices.\"\n",

So its basically in our DNA to be protective and place a high value on anything seen as offspring. Which pregnancy is seen as offspring.   I dont think its really related to anything vague like potential future of the fetus etc I think the underlying thing is the value humans place on our offspring.

The sheep gets very scared but tries to reason with the Wolf and tells him that it was infact him who was standing and drinking water from the Upstream portion of the river and that the river water can only flow downwards as they both can see. The sheep begs him to realize that there is no way that the water that she made dirty standing downstream could flow upstream and contaminate the Wolf's sips.

But the second we make a generality about data referring to human behavior, everyone loses their minds. I just don't get it. Generalities are not absolutes, they do not imply that absolutely ALL members of any group possesses a given characteristic. It simply means that, generally, group A does action B in situation C. I don't see what is so wrong with that provided there is data to back up a given claim.

If Mosque was already there, would supreme court had made the same decision and gave green light to destruction of it to build a temple?  ---  This Mosque was illegally destroyed so the ruling should assume that Mosque is already there.

What you are describing doesn't sound anything like that.  The \"red herring\" argument I guess could apply, depending on the context of the conversation. If someone keeps deflecting conversation away from current problems with the death penalty towards some ideal system where everything is rainbows and sunshine when that's not the point of the discussion, and using this to argue that the death penalty is good, then that could be a red herring. But bringing up secondary argument is not always a red herring.  Neither of these are formal logical fallacies, either.\"\n",

We have several premises:  **P1:** Jesus existed and is also God  **P2:** God exists  **P3:** Jesus believed in God (himself) and everything the Bible claims God (he) did. _______________  If we are taking those premises, then we also must accept the following conclusions:  **C1:** If God exists, then he did create the Earth in 6 days.  **C2:** Therefore, Jesus is perfect and self-consistent.  What you *should* be arguing against is either the existence of God, OR the premise/conclusion that he created the earth in 6 days. Whether Jesus is perfect is irrelevant if you have already asserted that he is the son of God. Ultimately, these two premises cannot co-exist:  **P1:** Human knowledge is perfect/complete in its understanding that the earth was not created in 6 days  **P2:** The Christian God/Jesus is real \"\n",

It is better to learn something like the [Trivium method](http://triviumeducation.com/) before doing your own research. The Trivium method gives a great toolset for anybody to learn and research for themselves.

I'll concede that my suggestion for the 2-brid cards was probably a bad one.  I can agree that they should stay as their singular colours instead of my idea of making them colourless.  However with concerns to the fun of deck building for the format, I have always found some restrictions non-sensical.  Why can I only play [[Scapheap Scrounger]] in a Black deck?  Why do I have to be running White **and** Red to play Archangel Avacyn?

About a third of the population experiences really strong feelings of disgust in the brain, about a third experiences mild feelings, and about a third experiences near-zero amounts of disgust when presented with something controversial.

Yes, the arguments used against trans-people now are nearly identical to the arguments used against queer people 30 years ago. But that indicates that *society will always have people resisting change,* rather than that any change is impossible.

Is she complaining about the song, because surely it's a positive cultural experience to have a non-Indigenous band learn an Indigenous language and use it in their song?  I looked it up and there's even an [article](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/the-preatures/8771564) about how the band went and consulted with the community and wanted to get approval that they were happy for her to sing it.  Maybe that's not what she's referencing, but I can't see what's wrong with that?\"\n",

But having random arbitrary rules for your diet based on its similarity to what a caveman ate doesn't really make sense to me.  If the problem is sugar and flour, cut sugar and flour, don't make up a diet for it and impose arbitrary rules based on some other stuff that HAPPENS to cut sugar and flour.

I think the answer may be that regardless of whether someone is highly-educated or otherwise smart, they could simply lack the initial reasoning and/or critical thinking skills that enable them to see why such conspiracies are wrong. This, coupled with a certain political outlook and emotional fixation could end up creating a self-serving pathology that is hard to break out of. This might explain why intelligent, respectable people are also prone to buy into conspiracy theories.  Just my two cents.\"\n",

If your in flight writes are *so important* that you can't do that, then you should be using a *mirrored* SLOG *and* it should be power fail safe *and* it should be fast at writes. It'll only get read in the case of an oh shit, so read speed doesn't matter. Most people think SLOG is a write cache, but it isn't. It is just a place for `sync` writes to live in case the system fails before that `sync` data in memory can be written to the pool as part of a normal flush.  The article [ZFS sync/async + ZIL/SLOG, explained](https://jrs-s.net/2019/05/02/zfs-sync-async-zil-slog/) by /u/mercenary_sysadmin is a good read about SLOG.\"\n",

How much do we expect the parents to suffer if we say they HAVE to take care of a unresponsive child that has little to no cognitive ability? They will have no freedom for the rest of their lives.

Its not only a moral issue either, it is sociological and frankly political. If someone will never grow mentally, they will never contribute and the parents' situation will never change. How much do we expect the parents to suffer if we say they HAVE to take care of a unresponsive child that has little to no cognitive ability? They will have no freedom for the rest of their lives.

Short-sighted as this may be, you yourself mentioned that we have a limited attention span and resources to read and digest manifestos, study the track record of politicians, or catch up on debates and town halls. Humans rely on heuristics when a quick judgement has to be made against resource constraints. Or, humans are lazy, so there is absolutely nothing wrong with voting along a single or several issues for elections. Advanced democracies do this. Brexit was predicated on a lie about NHS financing. Trump won because he painted his opponent to be more untrustworthy as him. In a perfect world, both wouldn't have happened, and I don't think anyone will deny that UK and the US are developed democracies.  &gt; Second, Id say a lot of people need to read up on history more. The older generation wouldnt be as outraged by this because the govt has ALWAYS been like. This tacit social contract between Singaporeans and govt has been in place since before a lot of people on this sub were born.  So what do you get by appealing to tradition? Just because we were in legit danger as a young country circa the Malayan Conspiracy times it means that we must uphold the same social contract our grandparents signed with the powers that be? We can't demand our government to a higher standard of accountability and transparency? We should be thankful that they don't jail all keyboard warriors under ISA 2.0 for 10 years for spreading fake news about TPTB because that's what they did to our forefathers during Coldstore?   &gt; Third, if youre vehemently against something, then please simultaneously think of the alternative solution youd prefer. I see far too many people complain about specific policies (not specifically fake news law) without giving their own better alternative.  Fallacy of false dichotomy/burden of proof. A diner doesn't have to cook better than their chef to be a critic. The electorate shouldn't bear the burden of proof of coming up with alternatives to show that a policy sucks. There's a reason why the Government is supported by research institutes, think-tanks, polling agency and data analytics experts to formulate policies. Asking the layman to come up with a proper alternative or shut up, especially if that retort comes from TPTB, is an indictment against our paternalistic and top-down approach to democracy, that we are serving our MPs and Ministers instead of the other way round.  Still giving you an upvote, because end of the day what we need is this: proper fucking discourse. Not the phony electorate outreach program REACH they use to create phony and dodgy figures whenever they need polling numbers to support a controversial policy, but actual discourse amongst the electorate to be educated and politically aware if not motivated.\"\n",

This does not even remotely relate to religion.  A religion like christianity also has no say in ethics, when the bible supports slavery, torture, rape and incest.  Things like murder and rape can be objectively determined to be detrimental to the survival of our species, to us as individuals and to us as a community.  This ties in with our evolutionary history as a social species which includes most of what we consider moral behavior.  Religion is also not necessary for morality.  Finally, the legal system in most countries with a state of law is also not based on the 10 commandments as some claim.  Only killing and stealing have some connection but as we said one does not need religion to punish these things.  The rest are all about god being insecure and jealous.\"\n",
