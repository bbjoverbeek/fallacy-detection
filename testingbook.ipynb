Viewing porn also causes prolonged dopamine exposure, which the brain will build resistance against - making it more difficult to feel joy from other daily activities.

      "POST: I feel like HLL is more of a hardcore BF where as PS looks more like Arma Lite. I want to enjoy a shooter with team work and strategy on a large scale. I like the relatively fast paced gameplay, less down time, more engagements, smaller maps and leathal weapons make for epic flanks, as a result i feel like as a single player i can have a decent impact on a game - i just enjoy the pacing and the way combat plays out (im nervous that the infantry vehicles will fuck this up). I'll admit that PS's wider range of factions does look very attractive but at the end of the day whats the point in having all these unique and interesting guns and what not when for most of the game you arent going to be using them because your going to be on the move and then when you do its spamming suppressing fire at a hedge. Edit: to be clear i might be 100% wrong about PS i havent played it but thats just the vibe i got from the gameplay ive seen.\n",
