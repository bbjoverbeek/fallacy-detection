However, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nThe argument relies on a false assumption that the person's lack of lung cancer is solely due to the absence of a smoking-related cause.

This argument is flawed because it is based on a single example, which is not representative of the entire population.

The premises only describe the appearance of tires before and after applying tire shine, as well as the availability of products. The conclusion being drawn is not supported by the premises.

The author's conclusion is that the shine is just cheaper and more readily available, but this does not logically follow from the premises provided. The"

The first part appears to be a statement criticizing the idea of joining the military, citing moral and practical issues for young people with disabilities or conditions that disqualify them. The second part of the text is a follow-up question about potential clerical jobs in the army.\n\nThere is no clear argument presented, with a conclusion and premises, to identify a specific fallacious argument type. The text lacks a logical structure, making it difficult to pinpoint a fallacy. Therefore, the correct answer is AA, indicating",
