This logic is called the fallacy of argumentum ad hominem, or the fallacy of personal attack. This fallacy happens when the argument focuses on someone's personal qualities or actions instead of the logic of the argument. In this case, the argument assumes that humans are invasive species because of their number, their impact on the environment, and our existence."

This text contains an appeal to emotion fallacy as the author attempts to sway the reader's emotions and opinion on the matter by appealing to their emotions and making a statement that seems emotional in nature. The author states that if Dr. Ford lied to the FBI it would be a huge win for Republicans and therefore Republicans should be eager to get her in front of an FBI interrogator. This statement is emotional in nature and attempts to sway the reader's emotions. A logical fallacy would be an argument that is flawed based on its premises and conclusion. In this case the author is attempting to sway the reader emotionally, and this is considered a fallacy of emotion. An argument that is based on false assumptions is also considered a fallacy as the author is stating that if Dr. Ford lied to the FBI it would be a huge win for Republicans, when in actuality it may not actually be a win for Republicans. Therefore, this is considered a fallacy of logic. The fallacy of this argument is that it is attempting to sway the reader's emotions and opinions without relying on logical reasoning."
