            "\nText: \"Violent video games cause teens to be violent, because violent teens play violent video games.\"\nThis text contains a fallacy of logic known as a slippery slope. The slippery slope fallacy occurs when one conclusion can be reached by a logical sequence of events, and other conclusions can be reached by the same logical sequence of events. The slippery slope fallacy is fallacious because it is possible to arrive at the conclusion from premises that are more general than the conclusion. For example, it is possible to arrive at the conclusion from premises like, \"violent video games cause teens to be violent, and teens",

The argument states that \"violent video games cause teens to be violent, because violent teens play violent video games\". The assumption is that because violent teens play violent video games, and violent video games cause teens to be violent, that violent video games are the cause of violent teens.

The premises establish that violent teens play violent video games, but they do not establish that violent video games cause violent behavior.

            "\nThe statement \"Refusing to acknowledge that you made a mistake and making excuses instead of being better. We're human. We're flawed - all of us.\" makes use of the fallacy of appeal to emotion. This fallacy is used when emotion is used to manipulate the audience or when emotion is used to avoid addressing the real issue or main point. In this specific case, the main point is not being addressed because the author is avoiding the actual issue by appealing to emotion through the use of the statement \"we're human. We're flawed - all of us.\"",

This fallacy is also known as the Appeal to Commonplace.",

The premise that \"we're human.
