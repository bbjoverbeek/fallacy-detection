We have laws already that make moral distinctions, yet they haven't been turned into something extreme. Just because something is morally complex doesn't mean maintaining it is impossible.   Frankly, most people who are against it argue on an emotional basis. Its not only a moral issue either, it is sociological and frankly political. If someone will never grow mentally, they will never contribute and the parents' situation will never change. How much do we expect the parents to suffer if we say they HAVE to take care of a unresponsive child that has little to no cognitive ability? They will have no freedom for the rest of their lives. If we are arguing on a moral basis, then it is purely subjective and making a room for the decision in the legal sense is more than justified.\n            ### Response: ['no fallacy']\nWhich one of these 4 fallacious argument types does the following text contain?\nText: ['FALLACY_TEXT']\nPlease choose an answer from AA, BB, CC, DD.\n### Response:",

I think an underlying mechanism of \"falling away\" from the church is that our own assumptions collapse. We no longer, well, *assume* them.  The fault in Pascal's wager is that it's a false dichotomy. It's between just two assumptions; the specific sect in question...or not.  But when your assumption that one sect stands out collapses, you have to consider *any* sect. When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect. Most Mormons have never seriously considered another religion being true, and they hold specific prejudices about why some aren't true (Catholics, Protestants).

You'll be on the freeway ramp selling oranges.\n            ### Response: ['no fallacy']\nWhich one of these 4 fallacious argument types does the following text contain?\nText: TITLE: Vote Leave fined and reported to police by Electoral Commission - The Guardian POST: Two groups working towards the same goal shared some information.

Things like murder and rape can be objectively determined to be detrimental to the survival of our species, to us as individuals and to us as a community.  This ties in with our evolutionary history as a social species which includes most of what we consider moral behavior.  Religion is also not necessary for morality.  Finally, the legal system in most countries with a state of law is also not based on the 10 commandments as some claim.  Only killing and stealing have some connection but as we said one does not need religion to punish these things.

Honestly, you probably don't even want a SLOG. You always have a ZIL, it is just either on the pool or the SLOG. Unless your work load has enough `sync` to cause slow downs, it isn't going to help. And if you *do*, you can achieve the same thing w/ `sync=disabled` on that dataset. If your in flight writes are *so important* that you can't do that, then you should be using a *mirrored* SLOG *and* it should be power fail safe *and* it should be fast at writes. It'll only get read in the case of an oh shit, so read speed doesn't matter. Most people think SLOG is a write cache, but it isn't. It is just a place for `sync` writes to live in case the system fails before that `sync` data in memory can be written to the pool as part of a normal flush.
