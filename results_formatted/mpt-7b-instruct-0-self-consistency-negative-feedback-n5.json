POST: Social media is the worst. People don't realize how much of an effect it has on someone, especially his generation. Anyone in the public eye who has any sort of mental health issue should rid themselves of their accounts if they possibly can. I understand studios force some actors to be active there, but if it's the difference between leading a happy, healthy life or getting a movie role, it really should be an easy decision. POST: Really, the worst? China has people in internment camps and people in the middle east get stoned for not wearing head scarves, but it's social media that's the worst? I think that's a massive exaggeration. Edit: I feel like I need to clarify that I'm not trying to deny what Pete is going through. I am however annoyed by a reference to a social media being\"the worst\". I'd even argue that saying that undermines the worse problems that he likely has going on here.\n\"\n\nPlease choose an answer from AA, BB.\n\nBefore identifying the fallacy, explain your reasoning thoroughly.

This fallacy is a type of logical fallacy where conclusions are drawn based on what is likely to occur, rather than on any logical or factual basis. In this instance, the author argues that Republicans would benefit politically if they called for an FBI investigation into Christine Ford's allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. The author claims that if Kavanaugh is innocent he would be demanding an FBI investigation himself. The author assumes that Republicans are motivated by political gain and would therefore be more likely to call for an FBI investigation if it would help them politically.

In this case, the author assumes that if Dr. Ford is telling the truth about being sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh, then she should be \"eager\" to be interviewed by the FBI. However, this is a case of \"Argument from Ignorance\" because the author has no evidence to support this assumption. Instead, the author is simply drawing a conclusion based on a lack of knowledge."
