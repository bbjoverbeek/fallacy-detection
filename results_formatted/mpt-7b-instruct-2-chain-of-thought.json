In the example above, the author assumes that since Mrs. Miller taught your older brother, who was the class clown, that she will be strict with you because you are also likely to be a class clown. However, there are other factors that may have contributed to Mrs. Miller being strict with your older brother, such as his behavior in other classes or his relationship with her. It is also possible that your older brother is simply a difficult student and Mrs. Miller chose to be strict with him regardless of his personality.
