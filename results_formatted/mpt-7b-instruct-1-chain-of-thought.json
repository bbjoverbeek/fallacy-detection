The appeal to emotion fallacy occurs when the conclusion is based on an emotion, rather than facts. For example, this argument assumes that, because the author disagrees with a law in another country, that the law is bad and that the author would agree with it being passed in their own country. This is not the case, as the author has no evidence that the author would agree with this law being passed in the country in which the author lives. This argument also assumes the following: that all laws based on religion are bad, that the author agrees with all laws, and that the author agrees with the premise that governments are willing to abuse their people.

In this case, the premises don't support the conclusion that 'this country cannot morally and socially and economically accept an economy running out the clock on the 20th Century'. The argument states the following:\n- 'we have families that are hurting'\n- 'we have people who are unemployed'\n- 'we have people with no property'\n- 'we have an administration that is demolishing public housing in our inner cities and not providing anything else but more public housing'.\nThe fallacy of logic occurs because the premises don't actually support the conclusion that the country cannot accept an economy running out the clock on the 20th century. The argument makes the conclusion based on the premises, but the premises don't actually support the conclusion."

This fallacy occurs when someone makes a statement or argument that assumes an opponent is arguing for a position that is not really held, and then attacks that position. Reagan's response can be interpreted as assuming that Carter is arguing to Congress that they must ratify the SALT II treaty as it is the best deal available, regardless of the deal's merits. In reality, Carter is arguing that the SALT II treaty is the best deal available at this time, and that he will continue to advocate for international arms control agreements until the US and USSR come to an agreement that makes the US safer."
