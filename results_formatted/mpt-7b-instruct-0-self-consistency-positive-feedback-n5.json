The premise \"refusing to acknowledge that you made a mistake and making excuses instead of being better\" is irrelevant to the conclusion \"what are the most cowardly things a person can do\". The fallacy of relevance is when a premise is not relevant to the conclusion.",
            "\nThe text is a fallacious argument because it is fallacious logic based on the argument type of \u201cBandwagon\u201d, which is a fallacy of Appeal to Consequence. This fallacy types occurs when arguments mischaracterize the consequences of a given action, which are then used to try to convince the audience that the action should be taken. In this case, the text argues that making excuses instead of owning up to mistakes is cowardly behavior, but does not explain what those consequences are that lead the author to this conclusion."
