We have laws already that make moral distinctions, yet they haven't been turned into something extreme. Just because something is morally complex doesn't mean maintaining it is impossible.   Frankly, most people who are against it argue on an emotional basis. Its not only a moral issue either, it is sociological and frankly political. If someone will never grow mentally, they will never contribute and the parents' situation will never change. How much do we expect the parents to suffer if we say they HAVE to take care of a unresponsive child that has little to no cognitive ability? They will have no freedom for the rest of their lives. If we are arguing on a moral basis, then it is purely subjective and making a room for the decision in the legal sense is more than justified.\n            ### Response: ['no fallacy']\nWhich one of these 4 fallacious argument types does the following text contain?\nText: ['FALLACY_TEXT']\nPlease choose an answer from AA, BB, CC, DD.\n### Response:", "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "prompt_features": ["few-shot"], "n_samples": 200, "temperature": 0.7, "top-k": 50, "max_new_tokens": 800, "random_seed": 42, "do_sample": null, "level": 1, "self-consistency repetitions": 1, "n_shot": 1, "1": {"fallacy_text": "TITLE: Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts POST: Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE.

The conclusion \"smoking cigarettes is deadly\" is not logically entailed by the premise \"cigarettes can kill you.\" The argument assumes that the ability of cigarettes to kill someone implies that smoking them is deadly, but this is not necessarily the case. There may be other ways to smoke cigarettes that do not make them deadly.

The fault in Pascal's wager is that it's a false dichotomy. It's between just two assumptions; the specific sect in question...or not.  But when your assumption that one sect stands out collapses, you have to consider *any* sect. When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect.

However, it still relies on simple keyword matching and may not detect all instances of the fallacies.

The premises describe the chaos and inefficiency caused by the policy, but they do not provide any logical connection to the conclusion that the policy is a disaster. The argument is making a leap from descriptive statements to a value judgment, which is not a valid logical inference.\n\nThe appeal to emotion is that the text is attempting to evoke an emotional response from the reader by describing the chaos and inefficiency caused by the policy. The text is using emotional language to try to persuade the reader, rather than presenting a logical argument.

The post urges people to \"unite together\" and \"stop this GOP cover-up\" using emotional language like \"Blow Up the Phones\" and \"we must indeed unite together.\" This is an example of an appeal to emotion (DD), as it tries to elicit an emotional response rather than a logical one.

A fallacious argument is an argument where the premises do not entail the conclusion. The four types of fallacious arguments are:\n- AA no fallacy\n- BB fallacy of credibility\n- CC fallacy of logic\n- DD appeal to emotion\n\nTo identify the type of fallacious argument, we need to analyze the given text and determine whether the premises entail the conclusion. If the premises do not entail the conclusion, then the argument is fallacious.\n\nFor example, in the first text, the conclusion is \"Don't bother. Honestly, you probably don't even want a SLOG.\" The premises are \"You always have a ZIL, it is just either on the pool or the SLOG. Unless your work load has enough `sync` to cause slow downs, it isn't going to help. And if you *do*, you can achieve the same thing w/ `sync=disabled` on that dataset.\" The premises do not entail the conclusion, as the conclusion is a subjective opinion and not a logical consequence of the premises. Therefore, the argument is a fallacious argument of type AA, which is a no fallacy.\n\nSimilarly, in the second text, the conclusion is \"Have any recommendations?\" The premises are \"Have you talked to a local recruiter? They can often place you in a position that fits your skills.\" The premises do not entail the conclusion, as the conclusion is a question and not a logical consequence of the premises. Therefore, the argument is a fallacious argument of type BB, which is a fallacy of credibility.\n\nIn the third text, the conclusion is \"It is a really good movie.\" The premises are \"The only reason I like this movie is because it has a great soundtrack.\" The premises do not entail the conclusion, as the conclusion is a subjective opinion and not a logical consequence of the premises.
