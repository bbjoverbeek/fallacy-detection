We have laws already that make moral distinctions, yet they haven't been turned into something extreme. Just because something is morally complex doesn't mean maintaining it is impossible.   Frankly, most people who are against it argue on an emotional basis. Its not only a moral issue either, it is sociological and frankly political. If someone will never grow mentally, they will never contribute and the parents' situation will never change. How much do we expect the parents to suffer if we say they HAVE to take care of a unresponsive child that has little to no cognitive ability? They will have no freedom for the rest of their lives. If we are arguing on a moral basis, then it is purely subjective and making a room for the decision in the legal sense is more than justified.\n            ### Response: ['no fallacy']\nWhich one of these 27 fallacious argument types does the following text contain?\n            Text: Your grouping of things in these 'boxes' is arbitrary and silly and has no clear basis in any serious epistemology or metaphysics.

The text states that two of the speaker's best friends are introverted, shy people who have cats, and then concludes that most cat lovers are really shy. This is a false analogy because the sample size is too small to make a generalization about all cat lovers. It is also an oversimplification of the relationship between being introverted, shy, and having cats.

We live in one of the best societies in the best times that humans have ever experienced.\" This is an emotional appeal, trying to make the reader feel good about the current state of America.\n* 'appeal to tradition': The text says \"NOBODY LIKES THE STATUS QUO.\" This is an appeal to tradition, implying that people generally dislike the current state of affairs.\n* 'hasty generalization': The text says \"NOBODY WANTS ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIANS ANYMORE.\" This is a hasty generalization, as it assumes that nobody wants establishment politicians, which may not be true for everyone.\n\nNote that these are my own interpretations and may not be the only possible answer.

The very question presupposes or assumes that there is reason to consider the  LDS church to be true.  I think an underlying mechanism of \"falling away\" from the church is that our own assumptions collapse. We no longer, well, *assume* them.  The fault in Pascal's wager is that it's a false dichotomy. It's between just two assumptions; the specific sect in question...or not.  But when your assumption that one sect stands out collapses, you have to consider *any* sect. When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect. Most Mormons have never seriously considered another religion being true, and they hold specific prejudices about why some aren't true (Catholics, Protestants).

Things like murder and rape can be objectively determined to be detrimental to the survival of our species, to us as individuals and to us as a community.  This ties in with our evolutionary history as a social species which includes most of what we consider moral behavior.  Religion is also not necessary for morality.  Finally, the legal system in most countries with a state of law is also not based on the 10 commandments as some claim.

It all comes down to individuals. Perhaps some men are more gifted at navigation. Perhaps some women aren't risk takers and comfortable being creatures of habit. The article mentions some women were as effective as men at the test, but it did not mention if the reverse was true. Plus, thinking about the way the test was administered suggests many men and fewer women would immediately adapt to the computer simulation, based on their own mention of proficiency with video games being the key to performing well on the test.

The text then uses a false dilemma (KK) by stating that one either believes in a higher power or not.\n5. The text also contains an ad hominem attack (EE) by stating that people who do not believe in a higher power are wrong.\n6. The text also contains an appeal to emotion (XX) by stating that people should not be ousted for their beliefs.\n7. The text also contains a false analogy (UU) by comparing driving a car to a relationship.\n\nThe correct answer is that the text contains multiple fallacious argument types.

The function preprocesses the text by removing punctuation and converting it to lowercase. It then checks the text for specific keywords and phrases that indicate the presence of a particular fallacious argument type. If the text contains a keyword or phrase, the function returns the corresponding fallacious argument type. If the text does not contain any keywords or phrases, the function returns 'no fallacy'.\n\nThe code then tests the function with the provided texts and prints the results. The output should match the expected results. Note that the function may not be able to identify all fallacious argument types, and may return 'no fallacy' even if the text contains a fallacious argument. This is because the function is based on a set of predefined keywords and phrases, and may not be able to identify all possible fallacious arguments.

POST: Yes. Porn has gained the support of popular culture, but it is unhealthy. It has been shown to make men more sexually aggressive, dissatisfied with their own sex lives, and contributes to the global sex trade. Viewing porn also causes prolonged dopamine exposure, which the brain will build resistance against - making it more difficult to feel joy from other daily activities. Porn is also highly addictive, and has diminishing returns over time, so a user will have to watch more porn, or more extreme porn, to get the same amount of dopamine.

What you are describing doesn't sound anything like that.  The \"red herring\" argument I guess could apply, depending on the context of the conversation. If someone keeps deflecting conversation away from current problems with the death penalty towards some ideal system where everything is rainbows and sunshine when that's not the point of the discussion, and using this to argue that the death penalty is good, then that could be a red herring. But bringing up secondary argument is not always a red herring.  Neither of these are formal logical fallacies, either.\n            ### Response: ['no fallacy']\nWhich one of these 27 fallacious argument types does the following text contain?\n            Text: Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.

On another note, then I would like to see stuff like BCNMs from FFXI.\r\nPOST: I like this a lot, though I still would like to see a lockout timer for the party that spawns it. Only because, while the requirement may seem intense and unrepeatable when it's first discovered, inevitably raiding guilds will amass the supplies to farm the item, and thus the boss, and will need to be slowed down. But otherwise, I think this is a great way to let a group try the raid when they're ready on their own time, without being punished by raid guilds. :) Now, I never played FFXI; what are BCNMs?\nPlease choose an answer from AA, BB, CC, DD, EE, FF, GG, HH, II, JJ, KK, LL, MM, NN, OO, PP, QQ, RR, SS, TT, UU, VV, WW, XX, YY, ZZ, AB.\n### Response:", "model_outputs": [" ['no fallacy']\nWhich one of these 27 fallacious argument types"], "predicted_fallacies": ["no fallacy"], "is_correct": [1]}, "164": {"fallacy_text": "TITLE: What is going on with my toenails?!

The text is analyzed to determine which type of fallacious argument is present, if any.\n\nThe first text \"As a parents, I'd say nope, that's not it. Not for most parents anyhow. Most parents don't assume that what their kids do reflects who their kids are. Think about it: babies are emotional wrecks who scream to get what they want and think only of themselves. But parents don't think they're \"bad\" because this is developmentally normal. Teens attach existential meaning to every interaction they have, think mainly of themselves and their peers, and respond dramatically to tiny things. But (good) parents don't think they're \"bad\" because this is developmentally normal.\" does not contain any fallacious argument type, so the response is ['no fallacy'].\n\nThe second text \"This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.\" contains the fallacious argument type'slippery slope'.\n\nThe third text \"why are those the only two choices?\" does not contain any fallacious argument type, so the response is ['no fallacy'].\n\nThe fourth text \"I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it.\" contains the fallacious argument type 'appeal to (false) authority'.\n\nThe fifth text \"WWI.  Atomic bombs.  Never change guys \" does not contain any fallacious argument type, so the response is ['no fallacy'].\n\nThe sixth text \"TITLE: Buy and sell in SD? POST: 1. Craigslist 2. Your stuff isn't worth nearly as much as you think 3. You may end up having to pay somebody to haul some of your stuff away 4. Again, craiglist 'gigs' is a good place to find somebody to pay to haul your 'valuables' away POST: Thank you!
