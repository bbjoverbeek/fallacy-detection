We have laws already that make moral distinctions, yet they haven't been turned into something extreme. Just because something is morally complex doesn't mean maintaining it is impossible.   Frankly, most people who are against it argue on an emotional basis. Its not only a moral issue either, it is sociological and frankly political. If someone will never grow mentally, they will never contribute and the parents' situation will never change. How much do we expect the parents to suffer if we say they HAVE to take care of a unresponsive child that has little to no cognitive ability? They will have no freedom for the rest of their lives. If we are arguing on a moral basis, then it is purely subjective and making a room for the decision in the legal sense is more than justified.\n            ### Response: ['no fallacy']\nWhich one of these 4 fallacious argument types does the following text contain?\n            Text: Your grouping of things in these 'boxes' is arbitrary and silly and has no clear basis in any serious epistemology or metaphysics.

The very question presupposes or assumes that there is reason to consider the  LDS church to be true.  I think an underlying mechanism of \"falling away\" from the church is that our own assumptions collapse. We no longer, well, *assume* them.  The fault in Pascal's wager is that it's a false dichotomy. It's between just two assumptions; the specific sect in question...or not.  But when your assumption that one sect stands out collapses, you have to consider *any* sect. When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect. Most Mormons have never seriously considered another religion being true, and they hold specific prejudices about why some aren't true (Catholics, Protestants).

Things like murder and rape can be objectively determined to be detrimental to the survival of our species, to us as individuals and to us as a community.  This ties in with our evolutionary history as a social species which includes most of what we consider moral behavior.  Religion is also not necessary for morality.  Finally, the legal system in most countries with a state of law is also not based on the 10 commandments as some claim.

It broke my heart. And he was flippant and dismissive. The Eucharist is not a reward or something you deserve if you are obstinate to church teachings POST: There are valid reasons to be both Catholic and support legalized abortion. Studies show that abortions occur just as frequently in nations where it is legal as nations where it is not. Nations with no legal abortions have higher rates of unsafe abortions, maternal death, and female teen suicide. We must care about the health and life of women too. These women are at their lowest and need compassion and safety. If restricting and banning abortion doesn't lower the rates of abortions, but instead causes more harm and death, it is not a good policy. <URL> Choosing compassion over virtue signaling should not place any individual in mortal sin. After all, 51% of US Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. <URL>\n\nPlease choose an answer from AA, BB, CC, DD.\n### Response:", "model_outputs": ["[DD]"], "predicted_fallacies": ["no fallacy"], "is_correct": [1]}, "45": {"fallacy_text": "TITLE: So Pointy!

In my opinion I don't think changing how Colour Identity interacts with Hybrid cards is in any way is against the spirit of the format.  I'll concede that my suggestion for the 2-brid cards was probably a bad one.  I can agree that they should stay as their singular colours instead of my idea of making them colourless.  However with concerns to the fun of deck building for the format, I have always found some restrictions non-sensical.  Why can I only play [[Scapheap Scrounger]] in a Black deck?  Why do I have to be running White **and** Red to play Archangel Avacyn?

I only say that because I think this idea would be a strategic game changer. Kickoffs would be more predictable for the teammate with more options to access the situation. They should just throw these in the game.   Also in addition to your highly impressive list of quick chats, they should add a third button to be pressed before making a quick chat. Not sure if that's the best way to explain it but, instead of pressing up up for \"Nice one!\" press up three times. That would allow for more options a player has for chat. Probably too many options but it's not a polished idea yet.\n            ### Response: ['fallacy of logic']\nWhich one of these 4 fallacious argument types does the following text contain?\n            Text: Ah, good ol appeal to authority.
