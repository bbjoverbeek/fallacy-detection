The speaker is trying to establish the truth of their conclusion by citing the support of 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, and many Republicans.

The speaker first mentions that \"every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.\" This implies that any action taken against terrorists must be thoroughly examined. However, the speaker then argues that the tools used against terrorists are the same as those used against drug dealers and white-collar criminals.

My reasoning is as follows: The argument attempts to establish the existence of God by associating him with the creation of everything. The creator is often seen as a divine being, so by making a connection between God and creation, the argument is implying that God's existence is guaranteed because he is associated with something good or desirable (creation).

However, the author", " AA\n### Explanation:\nThe given text contains the fallacy of guilt by association (AA). The speaker is trying to discredit President Bush's economic policies by associating them with President Obama's similar policies. The speaker is implying that because President Obama, who is considered more liberal and progressive, also had high deficits, then President Bush's deficits must be wrong. This is a fallacious argument because the speaker is trying to discredit someone's beliefs or actions by linking them to someone else who has similar beliefs or actions, without providing any evidence or logical connection between the two. The speaker is essentially saying \"Bush did it, so", " \nThe argument in the text contains the fallacy of **tu quoque** (PP). Here's my reasoning:\nThe speaker is criticizing President Obama for having large deficits, but they also mention that President Bush had large deficits during his presidency. The speaker is using this information to argue that President Obama is not justified in criticizing President Bush's deficits, as he himself has committed the same mistake. This is an example of the tu quoque fallacy, where one party accuses another of hypocrisy or double standards, rather than addressing the original issue or argument. The speaker is not addressing the issue of whether President Obama's deficits are", " 1\nI believe the given text contains the fallacy of **equivocation** (FF). Here's why:\nThe speaker is comparing President Bush's deficits to President Obama's deficits. However, the speaker is using the term \"right\" in a different way for each president. When President Obama is said to be \"right,\" it means he agreed with criticizing President Bush's deficits. But when the speaker says \"he was right,\" it implies that President Obama's own deficits were justified, which is not necessarily the case. This shift in meaning is an example of equivocation, as the term \"right\" is used", " (please provide your response in the text box)\nResponse:  (please provide your response in the text box)  I think the text contains a fallacious argument of the type \"False Analogy\" (QQ). The reasoning is that the president's actions in the past do not necessarily dictate their actions in the future.

The original poster equates the NRA with a terrorist organization, stating that the organization \"commits terror\" by advocating for laws that lead to gun deaths. This is an example of guilt by association, as the NRA is being linked to terrorism without providing any evidence that the organization is directly involved in terrorist activities. The original poster is relying on the negative connotations associated with terrorism to discredit the NRA, rather than engaging in a logical or evidence-based argument. The original poster's reasoning is flawed because it relies on emotional manipulation rather than logical reasoning", " \nI think the text contains the fallacy of Equivocation (FF). The argument is saying that the NRA is a terrorist organization because it encourages circumstances and laws that lead to 30,000 deaths a year. However, the definition of terrorism is typically associated with violent acts, such as bombings, assassinations, and other forms of violence. The NRA is not directly involved in these violent acts, but rather advocates for certain laws and policies that may contribute to gun deaths. The argument is equivocating between the term \"terror\" and its typical meaning, which is a form of violence, and the NRA's actions", " AA\n\nI have chosen AA as my answer because the text contains the fallacy of guilt by association. The argument implies that the NRA is a terrorist organization because it supports gun ownership and gun deaths occur.

The author is trying to get sympathy and attention by stating that they may get \"cancelled\" if they share their thoughts.

However, the opposing argument is not directly addressed. Instead, the poster shifts the focus to the NFL being a national organization and following federal laws, implying that this is a reason why medical marijuana should not be allowed. This is an ad hominem attack because it is attacking the NFL's character or motives rather than addressing the substance of the argument.

The poster is comparing Adderall, which is allowed with a prescription, to medical marijuana, which is banned. The poster is implying that since Adderall is allowed, medical marijuana should be allowed as well. This is a fallacious argument because it is using the fact that Adderall is allowed to justify the use of medical marijuana, even though there may be other reasons why Adderall is allowed that do not apply to medical marijuana.
