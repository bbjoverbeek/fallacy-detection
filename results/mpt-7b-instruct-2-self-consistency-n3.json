Democracy cannot survive if China is the global power.\" POST: Well, democracy gave us Trump to the whole world. I'll let others judge what democracy is. POST: Lets see what other system gave us. Communism gave us the Kim dynasty that destroyed their own country. Fascism gave us Franco that kept his country decades in the past in every manner. Monarchism gave us Leopold II of Belgium who committed genocides in Africa Theocracy gave us Pope John XII who fucked half of rome So as we can easily gather, every for of government had its share of shitty figureheads. That doesnt prove anything. At least in democracy we have the chance to switch them, you know what they do in other forms of government? Wait. North korea is still waiting on the Kim dynasty to die off, Spain had to wait until Franco dies to start modernizing, the people of Congo had to wait until Leo II died so they can stop getting killed, and the catholic world had to wait until John XII to normalize again.\n\"\n\nPlease choose an answer from AA, BB, CC, DD, EE, FF, GG, HH, II, JJ, KK, LL, MM, NN, OO, PP, QQ, RR, SS, TT, UU, VV, WW, XX, YY, ZZ, AB.\n\nBefore identifying the fallacy, explain your reasoning thoroughly.
