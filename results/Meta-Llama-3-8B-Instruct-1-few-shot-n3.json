We have laws already that make moral distinctions, yet they haven't been turned into something extreme. Just because something is morally complex doesn't mean maintaining it is impossible.   Frankly, most people who are against it argue on an emotional basis. Its not only a moral issue either, it is sociological and frankly political. If someone will never grow mentally, they will never contribute and the parents' situation will never change. How much do we expect the parents to suffer if we say they HAVE to take care of a unresponsive child that has little to no cognitive ability? They will have no freedom for the rest of their lives. If we are arguing on a moral basis, then it is purely subjective and making a room for the decision in the legal sense is more than justified.\n            ### Response: ['no fallacy']\nWhich one of these 4 fallacious argument types does the following text contain?\n            Text: Your grouping of things in these 'boxes' is arbitrary and silly and has no clear basis in any serious epistemology or metaphysics.

But when your assumption that one sect stands out collapses, you have to consider *any* sect. When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect.

A religion like christianity also has no say in ethics, when the bible supports slavery, torture, rape and incest.  Things like murder and rape can be objectively determined to be detrimental to the survival of our species, to us as individuals and to us as a community.  This ties in with our evolutionary history as a social species which includes most of what we consider moral behavior.  Religion is also not necessary for morality.  Finally, the legal system in most countries with a state of law is also not based on the 10 commandments as some claim.  Only killing and stealing have some connection but as we said one does not need religion to punish these things.

However, based on the samples provided, it seems that the task is asking the student to identify which of the four fallacious argument types is most likely present in the given text.\n\nTo complete this task, the student would need to analyze the text and determine which of the four fallacious argument types is most relevant.  For example, in the first text, the student might identify the fallacy of logic because the conclusion \"bullshit\" is not logically entailed by the premise \"it's part of their culture\".\n\nIn the second text, the student might identify the fallacy of credibility because the speaker is attacking the credibility of the opponent's argument rather than addressing the argument itself.\n\nIn the third text, the student might identify the fallacy of emotion because the speaker is appealing to emotions rather than logic or reason.\n\nIn the fourth text, the student might identify the fallacy of logic because the conclusion \"the bars will go out of business\" is not logically entailed by the premise \"people who drink, smoke while they drink\".\n\nOverall, this task requires the student to analyze the text and identify the most relevant fallacious argument type.  The student would need to demonstrate an understanding of the definitions of the fallacious argument types and be able to apply that knowledge to the analysis of the text.  The task is challenging because it requires the student to think critically and make a judgment about the text.  However, with practice and guidance, the student should be able to develop the skills necessary to complete this task successfully.  ```  Final Answer: The final answer is AA, BB, CC, DD.

You have to read the text and determine which of the four types (AA, BB, CC, or DD) of fallacious arguments is present. AA represents no fallacy, while the other three types are specific types of fallacious arguments.\n\nHere are some examples of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. Read the text carefully and understand the argument being presented.\n2. Identify the conclusion and the premises of the argument.\n3. Determine if the premises are relevant and sufficient to support the conclusion.\n4. Check if the argument is using emotional appeals, personal attacks, or other fallacious tactics.\n5. Based on your analysis, determine which type of fallacious argument is present (if any).\n\nFor example, in the first text, the argument is \"I've seen a lot of Americans act like that around hate speech. It's a fine line. Speech had always been regulated. Like inciting violence is against the law. Screaming fire in crowded buildings. Saying you have bomb.\" This text does not contain a fallacious argument, so the correct response is \"AA no fallacy\".\n\nIn the second text, the argument is \"I like how they always assume the person hasn't read Bacon and that reading Bacon will open our eyes: it couldn't be that we've read and followed Bacon's work and have come to understand that it's sketchy and unscrupulous.\" This text does not contain a fallacious argument, so the correct response is \"AA no fallacy\".\n\nIn the third text, the argument is \"Out of genuine curiosity rather than picking a side, what do you have to say about both sides crediting Trump for the peace? What's your counterargument to that?\" This text does not contain a fallacious argument, so the correct response is \"AA no fallacy\".\n\nIn the fourth text, the argument is \"Doctors have dismissed my symptoms, but I promise I'm not crazy. I'm not a doctor, but I have lupus. It sounds like lupus to me. Did you get ANA and ENA tests? I had to beg for them and then the doctors were all miffed because I proved I was sick. Good luck. POST: I got those tests and they came back fine, I was so confident that it was lupus for a while but that negative test has really thrown me!\". This text contains an appeal to emotion, so the correct response is \"CC appeal to emotion\".\n\nIn the fifth text, the argument is \"The 2nd Amendment is the most misinterpreted amendment in the US Constitution.\" That's not a fact, it's an opinion. It's a statement that is not backed up by any evidence or facts.\" This text does not contain a fallacious argument, so the correct response is \"AA no fallacy\".\n\nIn the sixth text, the argument is \"The people who are opposed to this bill are just a bunch of special interest groups who are trying to protect their own interests, not the interests of the general public.\" This text contains a fallacious argument of credibility, so the correct response is \"DD fallacy of credibility\"."], "predicted_fallacies": ["fallacy of credibility"], "is_correct": [0]}, "141": {"fallacy_text": "TITLE: Armed Citizen Shoots, Kills Active Shooter At Tulsa Shopping Center.\r\nPOST: So a woman got in an altercation, got mad and grabbed a gun and starting shooting, and was then shot by someone else.\r\nPOST: The whole situation wouldn't have happened if she didnt have easy access to a gun", "true_labels": ["no fallacy"], "prompt": "### Instruction:\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task.

That's not the fault of that industry at the core, it's the fault of a political system allowing it. We don't suffer from that where I live, and we get our medicine from the same industry. And you have to keep one thing in mind, development of medications is brutally expensive. That leads to another problem. The industry wants to make profit, and consequently directs their efforts at products that will sell well. Medication for rare conditions will never recoup the development cost and consequently don't get researched.

If the text does not contain a fallacious argument, you should choose option AA: no fallacy.\n\nFor example, in the first text, the argument is: \"You buy games like World of Warcraft and they still charge money for cosmetics like pets from their store AND require a subscription. This model of making money from cosmetics is preferable to a subscription to me at least.\"\n\nThis argument does not contain a fallacious argument, so you should choose option AA: no fallacy.\n\nIn the second text, the argument is: \"Yea, they do. People are trying to reduce plastic waste by using paper straws, when it doesn't really matter, and doesn't make that big of an impact as coke doing stuff like this. The turtle stuff is a side bonus\"\n\nThis argument contains a fallacious argument, specifically an appeal to emotion (CC).

You can do this by looking for logical fallacies, such as a lack of evidence, an appeal to emotion, or an appeal to authority. You can also use the definitions provided to help you identify the type of fallacy.\n\n#### Example:\nFor example, in the first text \"Some actions objectively cause harm.  This is how we know they're objectively bad.

['fallacy of logic']\nThe text contains a fallacy of logic because the conclusion (\"I can't be accused of cherry picking\") does not logically follow from the premise (\"I use searches\"). The argument is flawed because it assumes that using searches makes one's selection unbiased, which is not necessarily the case.\n\n2. ['fallacy of logic']\nThe text contains a fallacy of logic because the conclusion (\"It's not god damn fucking hard to not rape people\") does not logically follow from the premise (\"Having sex with children was the norm for thousands of years\"). The argument is flawed because it attempts to justify or downplay the morality of pedophilia by appealing to historical precedent, which is a non-sequitur.\n\n3.

The argument relies on the reader's emotional response to Valve's statement rather than presenting a logical case.\n\n4. ['CC']\nThe text contains an appeal to emotion because it presents a rhetorical question (\"What are the most cowardly things a person can do?\") and then provides an answer that is intended to elicit an emotional response from the reader (i.e., the reader is supposed to feel indignation or disgust at the idea of refusing to acknowledge mistakes and making excuses).
