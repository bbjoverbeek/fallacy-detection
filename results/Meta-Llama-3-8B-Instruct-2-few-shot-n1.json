We have laws already that make moral distinctions, yet they haven't been turned into something extreme. Just because something is morally complex doesn't mean maintaining it is impossible.   Frankly, most people who are against it argue on an emotional basis. Its not only a moral issue either, it is sociological and frankly political. If someone will never grow mentally, they will never contribute and the parents' situation will never change. How much do we expect the parents to suffer if we say they HAVE to take care of a unresponsive child that has little to no cognitive ability? They will have no freedom for the rest of their lives. If we are arguing on a moral basis, then it is purely subjective and making a room for the decision in the legal sense is more than justified.\n            ### Response: ['no fallacy']\nWhich one of these 27 fallacious argument types does the following text contain?\nText: ['FALLACY_TEXT']\nPlease choose an answer from AA, BB, CC, DD, EE, FF, GG, HH, II, JJ, KK, LL, MM, NN, OO, PP, QQ, RR, SS, TT, UU, VV, WW, XX, YY, ZZ, AB.\n### Response:", "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "prompt_features": ["few-shot"], "n_samples": 200, "temperature": 0.7, "top-k": 50, "max_new_tokens": 800, "random_seed": 42, "do_sample": null, "level": 2, "self-consistency repetitions": 1, "n_shot": 1, "1": {"fallacy_text": "TITLE: Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts POST: Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE.

It is a straightforward argument that concludes that all psychedelics should be legalized, regardless of whether they occur naturally or not, because the fact that something occurs in nature does not make it de facto good or safe. The argument is well-reasoned and does not rely on any fallacious appeals.\n\nThe second text contains the following fallacious argument types:\n\n* Appeal to emotion (VV): The text is trying to elicit an emotional response from the reader by emphasizing the potential benefits Russia will gain from the melting of sea ice.\n* Ad populum (XX): The text is appealing to the majority or the masses by stating that Russia will gain a \"strategic military advantage\" and \"access to shipping routes and energy reserves\", without providing any concrete evidence or logical reasoning.\n* Guilt by association (MM): The text is associating the loss of sea ice with President Putin's gain, without providing any logical connection between the two. This is an attempt to guilt-trip the reader into believing that the loss of sea ice is a negative consequence, simply because it benefits Putin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ['appeal to emotion', 'ad populum', 'guilt by association']."], "predicted_fallacies": ["guilt by association"], "is_correct": [0]}, "21": {"fallacy_text": "My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy.\n", "true_labels": ["false causality"], "prompt": "### Instruction:\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task.

I think an underlying mechanism of \"falling away\" from the church is that our own assumptions collapse. We no longer, well, *assume* them.  The fault in Pascal's wager is that it's a false dichotomy. It's between just two assumptions; the specific sect in question...or not.  But when your assumption that one sect stands out collapses, you have to consider *any* sect. When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect. Most Mormons have never seriously considered another religion being true, and they hold specific prejudices about why some aren't true (Catholics, Protestants).

Therefore, the correct response is ['HH', 'no fallacy'].\n\nThe second text contains two fallacious argument types: AA false causality and FF circular reasoning.\n\nThe conclusion is that banning Hummers will lead to the government banning all cars. The premise is that if we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment, then eventually the government will ban all cars. The problem is that there is no logical connection between banning Hummers and the government banning all cars. This is an example of false causality.\n\nAdditionally, the argument is circular because it assumes that banning Hummers is bad because the government will ban all cars, and then uses that assumption to conclude that we should not ban Hummers. This is a logical fallacy because the argument is using the conclusion to justify the premise, rather than providing independent evidence for the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is ['AA', 'FF']."], "predicted_fallacies": ["false causality"], "is_correct": [0]}, "73": {"fallacy_text": "My roommate from Maine loves lobsters, therefore all people from Maine love lobsters.\n", "true_labels": ["hasty generalization"], "prompt": "### Instruction:\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task.

The proverb presents a series of events that are causally linked, but the link between each event is not justified. For example, the loss of a nail does not directly cause the loss of a battle.\n3.

For example, the first response is ['no fallacy'] because the given text does not contain any fallacious argument. The second response is ['BB'] because the given text contains a false dilemma. Similarly, the third response is ['LL'] because the given text contains a false analogy, and so on. \n\n#### What does the code do?\nThe code identifies the type of fallacious argument in a given text. It uses a list of 27 fallacious argument types and checks if the given text contains any of these fallacious arguments. If it finds a match, it returns the corresponding fallacious argument type. If it does not find any match, it returns 'no fallacy'. \n\n#### How does the code work?\nThe code works by iterating over the list of fallacious argument types and checking if the given text contains any of these fallacious arguments. It uses a series of if-else statements to identify the type of fallacious argument in the text. If it finds a match, it returns the corresponding fallacious argument type. If it does not find any match, it returns 'no fallacy'. \n\n#### What are the advantages and disadvantages of the code?\nAdvantages:\n* The code is able to identify the type of fallacious argument in a given text.\n* It uses a comprehensive list of 27 fallacious argument types, making it a reliable tool for identifying fallacious arguments.\n* It is easy to use and understand.\n\nDisadvantages:\n* The code is limited to identifying fallacious arguments from a predefined list of 27 types.\n* It may not be able to identify more complex or nuanced fallacious arguments that are not included in the list.\n* The code may not be able to identify fallacious arguments that are not explicitly stated in the text, but are implicit in the argument. \n* The code may not be able to identify fallacious arguments that are not based on logical or philosophical concepts, but are based on emotional or psychological appeals. \n\n#### What are the potential applications of the code?\nThe code has potential applications in various fields such as:\n* Critical thinking and argumentation theory: The code can be used to identify and analyze fallacious arguments in philosophical, scientific, or everyday contexts.\n* Education: The code"], "predicted_fallacies": ["no fallacy"], "is_correct": [0]}, "132": {"fallacy_text": "TITLE: Need identify 2 lost parts.

I'll admit that PS's wider range of factions does look very attractive but at the end of the day whats the point in having all these unique and interesting guns and what not when for most of the game you arent going to be using them because your going to be on the move and then when you do its spamming suppressing fire at a hedge. Edit: to be clear i might be 100% wrong about PS i havent played it but thats just the vibe i got from the gameplay ive seen.\r\nPOST: You havent played but are talking about it like this?

It can be used to identify the type of fallacy present in a given text. The model is trained on a dataset of 27 different fallacious argument types and can recognize patterns and characteristics of each type.\n\nTo use the model, simply provide a text sample that contains a potential fallacious argument. The model will then analyze the text and respond with the type of fallacy it has identified. The model can identify the following 27 fallacious argument types:\n\n1. AA false causality\n2. BB false dilemma\n3. CC appeal to anger\n4. DD causal oversimplification\n5. EE appeal to ridicule\n6. FF circular reasoning\n7. GG fallacy of relevance\n8. HH no fallacy\n9. II slippery slope\n10.

The text presents an argument about breaking up large technology companies. The argument can be broken down into the following:\n    - Premise: 74% of voters support breaking up large technology companies to reduce their power and increase competition and innovation.\n    - Conclusion: Therefore, the government has no right to split up your business.\n2.  The argument is attempting to establish the conclusion that the government has no right to split up your business based on the premise that 74% of voters support breaking up large technology companies. However, the premise does not provide any logical connection or evidence to support the conclusion. The conclusion is an unrelated and unsubstantiated claim.\n3.
