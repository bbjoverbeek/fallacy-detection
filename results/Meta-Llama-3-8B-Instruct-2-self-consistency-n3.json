The speaker argues that the United States caused economic problems by denying Caribbean countries and third-world countries the opportunity to trade freely in the United States. The speaker then claims that this caused the country to have to bail out Mexico, resulting in a significant financial loss.\n\nThe equivocation occurs when the speaker uses the term \"caused\" in a different sense.

The argument is that if we do not go in with enough information, we will cause problems, and then we will have to bail them out, which will cost us a significant amount of money.

The conclusion \"Humans have moral value\" is assumed in the premises, specifically in premise P1. The premise P1 states that \"Humans have moral value,\" which is essentially the same as the conclusion.
