I hope it is correct. 2021-12-05 13:35:43 \u2013\u00a0Anusha Kulkarni\n\nI would like to provide a more detailed explanation of the response.\n\nThe given text is an example of a fallacious argument, specifically a false analogy (AA). The author is arguing that if the community starts with a high-level character, it will lead to a slippery slope where people will start asking for even higher-level characters, and eventually, a \"creative\" mode where they can access all items without having to farm. The author is drawing an analogy between starting a character at a high level and the hypothetical scenarios that may follow, but this analogy is false and lacks evidence.\n\nIn a false analogy, the author is comparing two things that are not similar, and using this comparison to support their conclusion. In this case, the author is comparing starting a character at a high level to the hypothetical scenarios that may follow, which is not a logical or evidence-based comparison.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is AA, false analogy. 2021-12-05 13:40:26 \u2013\u00a0Anusha Kulkarni\n\nThis response is not the only possible interpretation, but it is a plausible one based on the text.

The original poster is associating two different actions with each other, in order to shame or guilt the person who uses them interchangeably. This is an example of guilt by association, as it is an attempt to create a negative association between two actions that are not inherently related.

The conclusion is \"smoking cigarettes is deadly\" and the premise is \"cigarettes can kill you.\" The argument is trying to establish the truth of the conclusion by attacking the object of the conclusion (cigarettes) rather than providing a logical connection between the premise and the conclusion. 27\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe correct answer is MM. The text contains the fallacy of ad hominem (MM), which is an argument that attacks the person or entity making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. In this case, the argument is attacking cigarettes rather than providing a logical connection between the premise and the conclusion. 27\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe text is an example of a fallacious argument because it is using an ad hominem attack to try to establish the truth of the conclusion. The argument is not providing any logical evidence or reasoning to support the conclusion that smoking cigarettes is deadly. Instead, it is simply attacking the object of the conclusion (cigarettes) in an attempt to make the conclusion seem more convincing. This type of argument is considered fallacious because it is not a valid or logical way to establish the truth of a conclusion. 27\n\n### Related questions:\n\n1. What is an ad hominem attack?\n2.

This is an example of a false analogy (AA), where the conclusion is drawn from a superficial similarity between TV and radio advertisements, rather than a deeper understanding of the differences between the two mediums. The argument relies on the assumption that the effectiveness of an advertisement is solely determined by its reach and memorability, without considering other factors that might influence its effectiveness, such as the content of the advertisement, the audience's demographics, and the context in which the advertisement is shown. Therefore, the argument is a false analogy, which is a type of fallacious argument.... (show more)... (hide more)... (show more)...

The author makes a claim about how everyone in the world would look more favorably on someone who has had sex 100 times with one person versus someone who has had sex 1 time each with 100 different people.

The author does not provide any data or research to back up their claim, and it is likely that people's opinions on this topic are more complex and nuanced than the author's assertion.

This is an analogy that is not accurate and is meant to scare the reader into thinking that SMD soldering is extremely difficult. However, the author does not provide any evidence to support this claim, and it is not a valid comparison. The author is using a false analogy to make SMD soldering seem more intimidating than it actually is. This is an example of a false analogy fallacious argument, which is type AA.  more\n#### Feedback:\nYou have correctly identified the fallacious argument type in the given text as AA. Well done! The text does contain a false analogy fallacious argument, where the author compares SMD soldering to a \"dark art\" to make it seem more difficult than it is.
