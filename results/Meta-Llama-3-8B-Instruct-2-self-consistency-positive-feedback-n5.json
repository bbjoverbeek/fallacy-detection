Specifically, it is an instance of the \"appeal to false authority\" (XX). The reasoning behind this identification is as follows:\n\nThe argument relies heavily on the supposed endorsement of Happy Glossy toothpaste by \"four out of five dentists.\" However, the conclusion drawn from this premise, that the toothpaste \"must be great,\" is not logically supported. The recommendation of the dentists does not provide any direct evidence about the quality or effectiveness of the toothpaste.

However, this is a flawed assumption because the recommendation of dentists does not necessarily imply that the product is great. It is possible that the dentists have other reasons for recommending the product, such as financial incentives or personal biases.

This fallacy is an ad hominem attack that aims to discredit someone's argument by pointing out their past mistakes or hypocrisy. In this case, the speaker is attacking President Obama's argument about the high deficits by pointing out that President Bush had also had high deficits. The speaker is attempting to undermine Obama's argument by saying that he is a hypocrite, and therefore, his argument is invalid. The speaker is not addressing the issue of the high deficits, but rather attacking Obama's character.

POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

Specifically, the speaker is attacking Admiral Yarnell's authority and questioning his expertise, which is a classic example of the ad hominem fallacy. The speaker is not engaging with the arguments presented by Admiral Yarnell, but instead is trying to discredit him as a way to undermine the validity of those arguments.

However, the speaker is not providing any new information or evidence to support their conclusion, but rather relying on an authority (Admiral Yarnell) to make their point.\nThe fallacy of tu quoque (also known as \"you too\") is committed when someone attacks", " \nAfter analyzing the given text, I believe it contains the fallacious argument type \"TT ad populum\" (Appeal to the masses).

Instead, it's focusing on how people might feel about the situation, which is an emotional appeal.

The premises are that the poster is popular in Oculus sub reddit and people love his posts.", " 1. The fallacious argument type is: TT ad populum\n2. Explanation: The given text is an example of the ad populum fallacy, which is an appeal to popularity. The poster claims that the creator of the news papers is extremely popular in Oculus sub reddit and that people love it. This is an attempt to persuade the reader by referencing the popularity of the creator, rather than addressing the validity or truth of the news papers themselves.

This implies that the person must be either fully liberal or fully conservative, which is an oversimplification.

However, they divert attention from this main argument by focusing on a hypothetical 21-year-old individual who sent a dick pic to a 16-year-old girl.

This creates a false dichotomy, implying that there are only two possible solutions, and that one of them is clearly incorrect. However, this oversimplifies the issue, as there may be other solutions or middle ground that are not presented in the argument.\n\nThe argument relies heavily on emotional appeals,", " \n\nI believe the fallacious argument type in the given text is FF, ad hominem. The ad hominem fallacy is committed when an argument is attacked or criticized by attacking the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. In this case, the poster is attacking the idea of the sex offender registry being applied to 16-year-olds who send explicit images, but instead of addressing the argument itself, they are attacking the person making the argument by calling them \"horny\" and \"naive.\" The poster is not addressing the merits of the argument, but rather is trying to discredit the person making the argument"], "predicted_fallacies": ["appeal to emotion", "appeal to worse problems", "ad hominem", "false dilemma", "ad hominem"], "is_correct": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "182": {"fallacy_text": "TITLE: [For Hire] Computer Science Grad.\r\nPOST: Have you talked to a local recruiter?

My reasoning is that the text is using strong language and tone to evoke emotions such as anger and frustration.

If you need more information or clarification, please let me know. I'll be happy to help you out!", " [Your response here]\n\nI chose RR, False Analogy, as the fallacious argument type. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe text appears to be a discussion about politics and the author's perspective on a specific individual (JP) who discusses politics. The author is questioning JP's involvement in politics due to alleged bias. The relevant part of the text is:\n\n\"He *does* talk about politics. What JP *doesn't* do is circle jerk with the right. I think that's what you meant to say - 'can we stop with the right-wing circle jerk?'\"\n\nThe author is drawing an analogy between JP's", " I choose the fallacious argument type as FF (ad hominem) and my reasoning is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe given text contains an ad hominem attack, which is a fallacious argument type. An ad hominem attack is an argument where the opponent is attacked rather than their argument being addressed. In this case, the poster is attacking JP (John Paul) instead of addressing his argument. The poster states that JP \"talks about politics\" and that he doesn't \"circle jerk with the right.\" This is an attack on JP's character rather than an engagement with his argument. The poster is trying to discredit JP instead", " I chose DD (appeal to tradition). The fallacy in the text is the appeal to tradition. The speaker is saying that JP should not talk about politics because he doesn't \"circle jerk with the right.\" This is an appeal to tradition because it is implying that the right-wing is a bad thing, and therefore, it is tradition to avoid it. The speaker is using this tradition to support their argument that JP should not talk about politics. My reasoning is that the speaker is using a common negative view of the right-wing to make their point.
